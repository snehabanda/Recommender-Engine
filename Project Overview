The aim of the project was to build a recommender engine for the user, to help in decicion making of whether to buy a car or not. 
The location history data of the user if the input for the algorithm, which undergoes lot of data wrangling before it is subject to analysis. 
The data dump gives the latitude and longitude coordinates for huge set of timestamps. 
The first step is to calculate the distance travelled and the velocities associated, between each pair of timestamps. 
This data is analysed for pattern recognition, which is the most crucial part of the project. The journeys are identified, along with their start and end latitude and longitude coordinates. 
Once the journeys are identified, similar ones are clustered and the frequently travelled routes are identified. 
The time consumed in these journeys and thereby the time which would have been saved, if the travel mode was self-owned car, is calculated, thus arriving at the final recommendation whether the user sees benefit in owning a car or not. 
The R Code for the entire project is shared.
